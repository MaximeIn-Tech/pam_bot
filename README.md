# Pam's Voice Bot

## Project Overview

The idea of the project is to code and create a Telegram Bot that takes as an input a message with reversed text and send it back with the text in normal "way".

It is created to help Pam who suffered a brain injury and can only write in reverse. It will help her in her day to day life and also to communicate easily with her close ones.
